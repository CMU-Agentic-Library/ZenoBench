# Navigate to a place (`skill_001`)

`navigate(destination: place_ref)`

Drive the holonomic base to a free stand-off pose next to a room, piece of furniture, support, articulated part or object. The arm is tucked when empty, or held in the compact carry pose with the load.

## When to use

The robot must be in another room or next to another piece of furniture.

## Not to be confused with

- `approach`: approach fine-parks so the arm reaches one target; navigate only gets near.
- `retreat`: retreat moves straight back from a place without a destination.

## Inputs

- `destination` (`place_ref`): Where to go: a room, furniture, support, articulated part or object.

## Outputs

- `base_pose` (`pose2d`): Measured base pose [x, y, yaw_deg] at arrival.

## Applicability

Always applicable.

## Preconditions (checked on live GT state before moving)

- none

## Postconditions (verified on live GT state)

- `base_near(place=$destination)` — Base centre within 1.3 m of the place's footprint (inside the room for a room). GT: base_pose, scene_annotation.

## Verifier

after the policy chain, every listed predicate is evaluated on ground-truth simulator state (object poses, joint values, finger gaps, head-camera geometry, thermal state, event log); the node succeeds only if all hold for the selected path:

- `base_near(place=$destination)` (all paths)

## May invalidate

`base_near(*)`, `reachable(*)`, `facing(*)`, `in_view(*)`, `base_clear_of(*)`, `pointing_at(*)`, `presenting(*)`

## Policy paths (first match on the bound nouns)

### `two_hand_carry` — when robot.both_hold_same

1. `policy_097($destination) as plan`
2. `policy_058(@robot.right_object, #plan.pose)`
- An object held by both grippers moves at the slow bimanual carry speed.

### `carry` — when robot.right_held

1. `policy_097($destination) as plan`
2. `policy_002(#plan.pose, name=@robot.right_object, min_bottom_z=#plan.carry_bottom_z)`
- Back off, lift the load to carry height, plan with extra clearance, drive slowly.

### `empty` — when always (default path)

1. `policy_097($destination) as plan`
2. `policy_001(#plan.pose)`

## Relations

- Previous step: `retreat` (`skill_004`) (then) — the robot must leave after backing out
- Previous step: `stand` (`skill_006`) (then) — the robot drives after low work
- Previous step: `straighten` (`skill_008`) (then) — the robot drives after a bent reach
- Previous step: `tuck` (`skill_009`) (then) — the robot drives next
- Previous step: `reset` (`skill_010`) (then) — after a failed manipulation, before driving on
- Previous step: `search` (`skill_013`) (then) — the found object must be fetched
- Previous step: `pick` (`skill_017`) (then) — the object must be carried elsewhere
- Previous step: `lift` (`skill_023`) (then) — the object is carried over furniture
- Previous step: `close` (`skill_041`) (then) — the robot leaves
- Next step: `approach` (`skill_002`) (enables) — a manipulation target is on the destination
- Next step: `look` (`skill_011`) (then) — the destination must be observed first
- Fallback on failure: `retreat` (`skill_004`) (recover) — navigation fails because the base or load is wedged against furniture
- Fallback on failure: `tuck` (`skill_009`) (recover) — navigation fails because the empty arm cannot fold
- Fallback on failure: `lift` (`skill_023`) (recover) — a carried object hangs too low for the doorway clearance
- Is a fallback for: `approach` (`skill_002`) (repair) — no base pose near the current one reaches the target
- Is a fallback for: `look` (`skill_011`) (repair) — the line of sight is blocked
- Is a fallback for: `identify` (`skill_057`) (recover) — the object is not visible from here
- Alternative: `face` (`skill_003`) — turning in place is blocked by furniture
- Alternative: `sidestep` (`skill_055`) — a larger move is needed

## Failure

Stop and report the measured predicates, completed policy steps and matching fallback skills. Nothing is retried automatically.

- no free stand-off pose
- no base path
- carried object slipped (Dropped)
